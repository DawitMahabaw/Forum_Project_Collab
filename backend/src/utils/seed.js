(2) Route definition: confirm a parent <Route path="/question/:questionHash" /> (or equivalent) exists and matches the URL you refresh on — typos, missing :param, or a different basename break useParams(). (3) Quick sanity check: after refresh, log window.location.pathname and compare to your declared routes.
